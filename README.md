## Build from source code
### windows(amd64)
I have test it both on windows10 with mingw64 13.2.0 and windows11 with MSVC v143, Qt version >= 5.15.2.
follow these steps:
- install Qt5 or Qt6, cmake, MSVC or MinGW64 (should support **C++11 at least**)
- git clone this repo
- mk dir build, and run cmake in this directory
```bat
git clone https://github.com/JonahZeng/IIViewer.git
cd IIViewer
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=YOUR_QT_INSTALL_DIR
cmake --build . --config Release
```

### linux(amd64)
only tested it on ubuntu 20.04(cmake 3.16, Qt5.12.8, gcc 9.4.0), here are the steps:
```bash
sudo apt install build-essential qt5-default libqt5datavisualization5-dev cmake
git clone https://github.com/JonahZeng/IIViewer.git
cd IIViewer
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build . -j 4
```

### macos
I didn't have any mac device, but I'm sure compile this project on macos would not be diffcult since this project use cross-platform build tool(cmake).
