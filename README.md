## how to build from source code
### windows
I have tested build it on windows10 with mingw64 13.2.0, also windows11 with MSVC v143.
so, follow below steps:
- install Qt5 or Qt6, cmake, MSVC or MinGW64 (should support **C++11 at least**)
- git clone this repo
- mk dir build, and run cmake in this directory
```bat
git clone https://github.com/JonahZeng/IIViewer.git
cd IIViewer
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=YOUR_QT_INSTALL_DIR
cmake --build . --config Release
```

### linux
I did not tested very much, just had a try on Ubuntu 22.04, it works.
